# -Iris-Flowers-Classification-ML-Project
This is one of the most simple machine learning projects with Iris Flowers being the simplest machine learning datasets in classification literature. This machine learning problem is often referred to as the “Hello World” of machine learning. The dataset has numeric attributes and ML beginners need to figure out how to load and handle data. The iris dataset is small which easily fits into the memory and does not require any special transformations or scaling, to begin with.
The goal of this machine learning project is to classify the flowers into among the three species – virginica, setosa, or versicolor based on length and width of petals and sepals. You can also add this project to your deep learning projects portfolio by implementing advanced algorithms.
Iris Classification Problem
Along this notebook we'll explain how to use the power of cloud computing with Google Colab for a classical example –The Iris Classification Problem– using the popular Iris flower dataset.

For this classification problem we will build a simple feed-forward full-connected artificial neural network.

The Python framework that we will be using is Tensorflow 2.0 with the Keras module.

Problem statement
Before we tackle the problem an ANN, let's understand what we'll be doing:

If we feed our neural network with Iris data, the model should be able to determine what species it is.
What do we need to do?
Train a Deep Learning model (in this case) using a known dataset: Iris flower dataset.

Specifically, we are going to do the following:

Load the dataset
Preprocess the data
Build the model
Set hyperparameters
Train the model
Save and download the trained model
Predict data
Installing dependencies
For our training we will be using Tensorflow 2.0, so we want to be sure it is installed on its latest version:
